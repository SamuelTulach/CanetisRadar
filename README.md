CanetisRadar is open-source application for helping with recognizing sound direction in games. It has overlay that can be used in games and it uses 7.1 audio to calculate sound direction.

## Voicemeter Banana Setup (Better)
You need 7.1 audio device to be connected and selected as primary speaker (including side speakers), but don´t worry. You can also use virtual audio device. First of all check if your sound card or headphones does not support it and if they don´t use this guide.

 1. Download [Voicemeeter-Banana](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm) 
 2. Install it
 3. **Reboot PC**
 4. Go to "Change System Sounds"
 5. Open *Playback* tab
 6. Set *Voicemeeter Input* as default
 7. Click on *Configure*
 8. Set sound to *7.1 surround* and enable all speakers
 9. Open *Voicemeeter Banana*
 10. Set your Hardware Output A1 to the preferred Device (Speakers, Headset etc) 
 11. In the Master Section for A1, click where it says "Normal Mode" and change it to "Mix down B" (Mix Down A doesnt work in some games)
 12. Check that Virtual Input "Voicemeeter VAIO" Plays to A1 (Button A1 highlighted Green)
 13. Set Voicemeeter Virtual Input as your Speaker everywhere
 14. Set Voicemeeter Banana to Autostart and Autorestart
 15. Profit
 16. If you dont want e.g. Discord Sound to appear on Sound Radar -> set output device in your Discord Settings as normal (not Virutal Input)

## VB Cable Setup (alternative)

 1. Download [VB-Cable](https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/) 
 2. Install it
 3. **Reboot PC**
 4. Go to sound settings 
 5. Open *Playback* tab
 6. Set *CABLE Input* as default
 7. Click on *Configure*
 8. Set sound to *7.1 surround* and enable all speakers
 9. Go to *Recording* tab
 10. Click on CABLE Output and click *Properties*
 11. Go to *Listen* tab
 12. Check *Listen to this device*
 13. Set your normal playback device
 14. Profit
